# CryptoScamHunter

Our project was born with the aim of making the crypto-financial environment a safer place.

For this reason we are activily investigating and tracking websites that want to cheat crypto-holders.

---

### What CryptoScamHunter does

 * Our team manually analyzes suspected scam websites and then updates the blacklists we have created and which can be used to block fraudulent websites.
 * Our team reports all scammers who use Twitter or Telegram to scam victims. We gather and send proofs and information about the scammer to the Telegram / Twitter Abuse Reporting.

#

### Why are these websites still online

These websites usually last a few years. Quite often, while they are active, the real IP of the server that is hosting them is protected by systems like CloudFlare, therefore, the authorities find it difficult to completely remove the website from the internet.

#

### What you can do to avoid these sites

You can donwload our blacklists:

- https://github.com/amoccia/CryptoScamHunter/blob/main/BlackList

and use it in a browser plugin, in your firewall or updating your PC's host file.
